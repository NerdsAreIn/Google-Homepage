Preface: This project, whose sole author is myself, NerdsAreIn, will serve to demonstrate the skills that I have learnt at the halfway mark of The Odin Project's Web Development 101 course. It will provide an opportunity to consolidate my HTML and CSS learning, before I move on to the JavaScript stage. I will attempt to create a non-functional simulacrum of the Google Search homepage, using pure HTML and CSS.
